--- abstract

This document describes an extension to the MLS protocol {{!RFC940}} that
improves its efficiency in terms of per-member download size. This comes at
esssentially no cost. In essence, this document defines a new message type
called split commit which replaces regular MLS commits. Unlike regular commits,
a split commit can be "split" by the Delivery Service (DS) into much smaller
split commits, one for each receiving member. The size of a downloaded split
commit is always logarithmic in the group size, while the size of a regular
MLS commit can be linear. This extension works in settings with a DS that can
do the splitting which can be demanding with encrypted MLS handshake messages.

# Introduction

The MLS protocol requires a Delivery Service (DS), one function of which is to
distribute protocol packets between group members.

TODO Introduction

This is motivated by academic research {{HKP22}}, {{HKPPW22}}, {{AHKM33}}.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Split Commits

Apart from regular commits, group members upload and download a new type of
MlsMessage called SplitCommitMessage. It contains a SplitUpdatePath object
which the DS can pre-process before delivering by removing unnecessary
ciphertexts. Further, it contains a `split_commit_message` MlsMessage which is
a framed SplitCommit object. It can be a PublicMessage in which case it's only
signed, or a PrivateMessage in which case it's signed and encrypted.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    UpdatePathNode nodes<V>;
} SplitUpdatePath;

struct {
    opaque epoch_identifier<V>;
    ProposalOrRef proposals<V>;
    optional<LeafNode> leaf_node;
} SplitCommit;

struct {
    // PrivateMessage or PublicMessage
    MLSMessage split_commit_message;
    optional<SplitUpdatePath> path;
} SplitCommitMessage;
~~~

The SplitCommit object is a new content type and SplitCommitMessage is a new
wire format. Other MLS objects account for this as specified below.

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
    reserved(0),
    application(1),
    proposal(2),
    commit(3),
    split_commit(4),
    (255)
} ContentType;

struct {
    opaque signature<V>;
    select (FramedContent.content_type) {
        case commit:
            MAC confirmation_tag;
        case application:
        case proposal:
        case split_commit:
            struct{};
    };
} FramedContentAuthData;

struct {
    opaque group_id<V>;
    uint64 epoch;
    Sender sender;
    opaque authenticated_data<V>;

    ContentType content_type;
    select (FramedContent.content_type) {
        case application:
          opaque application_data<V>;
        case proposal:
          Proposal proposal;
        case commit:
          Commit commit;
        case split_commit:
          SplitCommit split_commit;
    };
} FramedContent;

struct {
    ProtocolVersion version = mls10;
    WireFormat wire_format;
    select (MLSMessage.wire_format) {
        case mls_public_message:
            PublicMessage public_message;
        case mls_private_message:
            PrivateMessage private_message;
        case mls_welcome:
            Welcome welcome;
        case mls_group_info:
            GroupInfo group_info;
        case mls_key_package:
            KeyPackage key_package;
        case mls_split_commit:
            SplitCommitMessage split_commit_message;
    };
} MLSMessage;
~~~

A committing group member generates a SplitCommitMessage using the following
steps:
1. Perform a regular MLS commit, without message framing.
2. Export a secret `epoch_identifier` from the new epoch with the label
   "SplitCommit".
3. Generate a SplitCommit object `split_commit` with `epoch_identifier` from
   Step 2 and `leaf_node` from `path` in the commit generated in Step 1.
4. Generate MlsMessage `split_commit_message` by framing `split_commit`.
5. Output SplitCommitMesage with `path` including `nodes` from `path` in the
   commit in Step 1, `epoch_identifier` from Step 2 and `split_commit_message`
   from Step 4.

If the DS knows the ratchet trees before and after the split commit, it
processes a SplitCommitMessage before delivering it to a receiver group
member as follows:
1. If the receiver remains in the group after the commit:
  * Remove from `path` all ciphertexts except the one that the receiver will
    decrypt.
  * Remove from `path` all nodes for which the receiver can derive public keys,
    that is all nodes on the path from the LCA of the receiver and the
    committer to the root (inclusive)
    [**TODO: this will likely NOT work since AFAIR the NEW context is used to do
    HPKE encryption, so we need all path to decrypt. I donâ€™t know how this
    helps security in any way.**]
2. Else if the commit removes the receiver
  * Remove the `path`
{{Delivering Split Commits without the Ratchet Tree}} considers DS's that do not
know the ratchet tree.

A receiver group member processes a SplitCommitMessage using the following steps:
1. Process the `split_commit_message` MLSMessage to recover `split_commit`.
2. Verify that `path` contains exactly one ciphertext. Recover `path_secret` by
   decrypting that ciphertext.
3. Use `path_secret`, public keys from `path` and `proposals` to process the
   commit as specified in {{!RFC9420}}.
4. Verify that `epoch_identifier` in `split_commit` matches the secret exported
   from the new epoch with the label "SplitCommit" .


# Transcript Hashes

With split commits, the input to the confirmed transcript hash is the same as
in {{!RFC9420}}. In particular, it contains the FramedContent with a
SplitCommit object inside. Split commits contain no confirmation tags, so the
interim transcript hash is simply equal to the confirmed transcript hash.


# Delivering Split Commits without the Ratchet Tree

If the DS does not know the ratchet tree, then it cannot determine which
ciphertexts to deliver to which members. Dealing with this is outside the scope
of this document.

In general, there are several ways to deal with this. For example, the sender
can annotate the ciphertexts in the split commit. Alternatively, the receiver
can "pull" the split commit without `path`, identify the sender and indicate
the index of the ciphertext it expects before pulling it. However, most DS's
work in the push not pull model and are therefore incompatible with this
solution.


# Security Considerations

## Transcript Hashes

The transcript hash with split commits covers FramedContent with a SplitCommit
that contains `epoch_identifier`, `proposals` and `leaf_node`. The transcript
hash with regular commits covers FramedContent with a Commit that contains
`proposals`, `leaf_node` and `path`, as well as the confirmation tag.

Since `epoch_identifier` is derived from the key schedule and the tree hash of
the new epoch is mixed into the key schedule, the transcript hash with split
commits binds the public keys from `path`. There is no security-related reason
to agree on ciphertexts, so there is no reason to include `path` in the
transctipt hash. Note that group members do agree on *content* of the
ciphertexts in `path`. That is, they agree on the commit secret hashed into
the key schedule (and used to derive `epoch_identifier`), so they also agree
on all path secrets that they can derive (assuming no hash collisions).
